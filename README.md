# ATAC-seq Signal Processing 

This part of the project focuses on:

- Wrangling ATAC-seq signal data 
- Analyzing signal variability across samples 

The goal is to transform the raw ATAC-seq signal matrix into a tidy format and then assess per-sample variability (mean, median, standard deviation, CV).

## Part 1 â€“ ATAC-seq Wrangling 

### Input
- **Folder:** `ATAC-seq/`
- Contains all raw and intermediate ATAC-seq files used for wrangling: 

- `ATAC-seq data.csv`: Original wide-format signal matrix (rows = peaks, columns = all samples). Not modified to avoid accidental deletion.
- `filtered_ATAC_abT_Tact_Stem.csv`: Subset of the original matrix, keeping only columns related to abT and T.act cell types.
- `refined_ATAC.csv`: Tidy-format table with selected samples and peaks reshaped into three columns: `peakID`, `SampleID`, and `Signal`.

### Method
1. **Filter for abT and T.act samples**
   - File used: `filtered_ATAC_abT_Tact_Stem.csv`
   - Only keeps columns corresponding to abT and T.act cell types.

2. **Refine and reshape**
   - File: `refined_ATAC.csv`
   - Reformats the data to include:
     - `peakID`
     - `SampleID`
     - `Signal`
   - Puts sample type (abT or T.act) and signal values into two columns (long format).

### Output
- **Final output:** `refined_ATAC.csv`  
- This tidy-format file will be used for variability analysis in the next step.
